# Version: 02 (Added _WIN32_WINNT and WINVER definitions to MSBuild command line)

# This header should be updated keeping the same format on every interaction.
# Static things and recomendations for AI:
#
#  1ยบ Comments in this file are always in english
#  2ยบ Version has to be updated by each IA interatiction
#  3ยบ Bellow this section the AI should explain every success step on build proccess
#  4ยบ Do not change this header structure
