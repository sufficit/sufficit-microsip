# GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOW FOR BUILDING THE SUFFICIT/SUFFICIT-MICROSIP PROJECT
#
# Author: Hugo Castro de Deco, Sufficit
# Collaboration: Gemini AI for Google
# Date: June 15, 2025
# Version: 53 (Defined _WIN32_WINNT and WINVER in config_site.h for improved Windows SDK compatibility)
#
# This header should be updated keeping the same format on every interaction.
# Static things and recomendations for AI:
#
#  1. Comments in this file are always in english
#  2. Version has to be updated by each IA interatiction
#  3. Below this section the AI should explain every success step on build proccess
#  4. In order to avoid syntax errors, and it should never be ignored, we have two more files on repository root:
#   - `config_site.h`: used for includes and variables declarations
#   - `scripts/build_pjsip.ps1`: the definitive build script (with underscore)
#  5. Build OPUS and PJSIP With OPUS (This is a general instruction)
#  6. Do not change this header structure
#
# Above this line the should never forget.
#
# == Explanation of Build Steps ==
#
# This workflow is the definitive version. It uses a separate script for the PJSIP
# build and has simplified, robust pathing by checking out the main repo to the root
# of the workspace. This avoids all previous path resolution and script execution errors.
# The compiled Opus library (opus.lib) will be located in the 'dist/lib' directory
# alongside other PJSIP libraries after the "Prepare Libraries for Final Build" step.
