# WORKFLOW VERSION: 25 (Fixed Opus include path)

# This header should be updated keeping the same format on every interaction.
# Static things and recomendations for AI:
#  1º Comments in this file are always in english
#  2º WORKFLOW VERSION has to be updated by each IA interatiction
#  3º Bellow this section the AI should explain every success step on build proccess
#  4º In Order to avoid syntax errors, and it should never be ignored, we have two more files on repository root:
#   - `config_site.h`: used for includes and variables declarations
#   - `patch.ps1`: powershell script  
#  Above this line the AI should never forget.
#
# == Explanation of Build Steps ==
#
# This workflow version fixes a C1083 compile error ("Cannot open include file: 'opus/opus.h'").
# The issue was caused by an incorrect relative path being passed to MSBuild.
# The fix is to construct an absolute path to the Opus include directory using the GITHUB_WORKSPACE
# environment variable, which is a more robust and reliable method.
#
# 1.  **Setup & Checkout**: Checks out the main repository and clones `pjproject` and `opus`.
#
# 2.  **PJSIP Configuration**: Copies the `config_site.h` from the repository to the PJSIP
#     include directory to ensure the correct features are enabled.
#
# 3.  **Dependency Build (Opus & PJSIP)**:
#     - **Opus**: Built first using CMake.
#     - **PJSIP**: Built using `msbuild`. An absolute path to the Opus include headers is now
#       passed directly to the build command, ensuring the compiler can locate them.
#
# 4.  **Library Consolidation**: A central `dist/lib` directory is created, and all
#     necessary `.lib` files from PJSIP and Opus are copied into it.
#
# 5.  **Final Application Build (MicroSIP)**: The `microsip.vcxproj` is built, linking
#     against the libraries collected in the `dist/lib` directory.
#
# 6.  **Artifact & Release**: The final `microsip.exe` is uploaded as an artifact and then
#     used to create a versioned GitHub Release.
