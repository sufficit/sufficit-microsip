# GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOW FOR BUILDING THE SUFFICIT/SUFFICIT-MICROSIP PROJECT
#
# WORKFLOW VERSION: 28 (Simplified patch step)
#
# Author: Hugo Castro de Deco, Sufficit
# Collaboration: Gemini AI for Google
# Date: June 13, 2025
# 
# Static things and recomendations for AI, you should never alter these recommendations and never skip any of these:
#  1º Comments in this file are always in english
#  2º WORKFLOW VERSION has to be updated by each IA interatiction
#  3º Bellow this section the AI should explain every success step on build proccess
#  4º In Order to avoid syntax errors, and it should never be ignored, we have two more files on repository root:
#   - `config_site.h`: used for includes and variables declarations
#   - `patch.ps1`: powershell script (user must ensure this is the corrected version)
#
# == Explanation of Build Steps ==
#
# This workflow assumes that the `patch.ps1` script in the repository has been manually
# updated by the user. The step to dynamically modify the script has been removed for clarity
# and correctness.
#
# 1.  **Setup & Checkout**: Checks out all necessary repositories.
#
# 2.  **Configuration**: Copies the `config_site.h` to the PJSIP directory.
#
# 3.  **Run PJSIP Patch**: Executes the user's `patch.ps1` script directly.
#
# 4.  **Build Dependencies & Main Project**: Builds Opus, then PJSIP, and finally the
#     main MicroSIP application.
#
# 5.  **Artifact & Release**: Packages the final `microsip.exe` and creates a GitHub Release.
